# Things We Learnt From This Project 
We through this project learned a great deal. We learned more python and about its module. We got the oppurtunity to learn streamlit which now, has become my favourite module for gui in python and we also learnt great deal about other modules thanks to this experience we have become better programmers and we
are grateful for the opputunity presented to us.
